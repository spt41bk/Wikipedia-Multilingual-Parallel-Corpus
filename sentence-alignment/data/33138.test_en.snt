man - sized sea scorpion claw found
the immense fossilised claw of a 2.5m - long sea scorpion has been described by european researchers .
the 390-million-year-old specimen was found in a germany quarry , the journal biology letters reports .
the creature , which has been named jaekelopterus rhenaniae , would have paddled in a river or swamp .
the size of the beast suggests that spiders , insects , crabs and similar creatures were much larger in the past than previously thought , the team says .
the claw itself measures 46cm - indicating its owner would have been longer even than the average - sized human .
overall , it exceeds the record for any other sea scorpion ( eurypterid ) find by nearly 50cm .
the eurypterids are believed to be the extinct aquatic ancestors of modern land scorpions and possibly all arachnids ( the class of animals that also includes spiders ) .
the biggest scorpion today is nearly 30cm so that shows you how big this creature was , said dr simon braddy from the university of bristol , uk .
it was one of dr braddy ' s co - authors , markus poschmann , who made the discovery in the quarry near prum in south - west germany .
i was loosening pieces of rock with a hammer and chisel when i suddenly realised there was a dark patch of organic matter on a freshly removed slab , he recalled .
after some cleaning i could identify this as a small part of a large claw .
although i did not know if it was more complete or not , i decided to try and get it out .
the pieces had to be cleaned separately , dried , and then glued back together .
it was then put into a white plaster jacket to stabilise it .
super - sized meals
the fossil was locked in a siltstone from the carboniferous period
the species existed during a period in earth history when oxygen levels in the atmosphere were much higher than today .
and it was those elevated levels , some palaeo - scientists believe , that may have helped drive the super - sized bodies of many of the invertebrates that existed at that time - monster millipedes , huge cockroaches , and jumbo dragonflies .
but dr braddy thinks the large scales may have had a lot to do with the absence early on of vertebrate predators .
as they came on the scene , these animals would have eaten all the biggest prey specimens .
the fact that you are big means you are more likely to be seen and to be taken for a tastier morsel , he told bbc news .
evolution will not select for large size ;
you want to be small so you can hide away .
the scorpions are thought to have made their first scuttles on to land about 450 million years ago .
while some would have taken up a fully terrestrial existence , others like jaekelopterus rhenaniae would have maintained an aquatic or semi - aquatic lifestyle .
