babies ' show social intelligence '
at the age of six months , most babies have barely learnt to sit up , let alone crawl , walk or talk .
but , according to new research , they can already assess someone ' s intentions towards them , deciding who is a likely friend or enemy .
scientists believe babies acquire the ability to make social evaluations in the first few months of life .
it may provide the foundation for moral thoughts and actions in later years , they write in the journal nature .
by six months , babies have learnt quite a lot and they are taking things in , said kiley hamlin , lead author of the research .
we can ' t say that it is hard - wired ( exists in a newborn baby ) but we can say it is pre - linguistic and pre - explicit teaching , she told bbc news .
we don ' t think this says that babies have any morality .
but it does seem an essential piece of morality to feel positive about those who do good things and negative about those who do bad things -
it seems like an important piece of a later more rational and moral system .
infant lab tests
like all social creatures , humans are able to make rapid judgements of other people based on how they behave towards others .
but the roots of this behaviour and when it develops are not well understood .
kiley hamlin and colleagues at yale university devised experiments to test whether babies aged six and 10 months were able to evaluate the behaviour of others .
they used wooden toys of different shapes that were designed to appeal to babies .
the babies were sat on their parents ' laps and shown a display representing a character trying to climb a hill .
the climbing character , which had eyes to make it human - like , was either knocked down the hill by an unhelpful character ( a toy of a different shape and colour ) or pushed up the hill by a helper cartoon figure ( another shape and colour ) .
babies are smarter than we think
after watching the puppet show several times , each baby was presented with the helper and hinderer toys and asked to pick one .
all of the 12 six-month - old babies tested and 14 of the 16 10-month - olds reached out to touch the helper character rather than the anti - social one .
further experiments were carried out to rule out other explanations for the behaviour - such as a preference for pushing up or down actions or the appearance of certain characters .
our findings indicate that humans engage in social evaluation far earlier in development than previously thought , and support the view that the capacity to evaluate individuals on the basis of their social interactions is universal and unlearned , the authors wrote in nature .
social creatures
evidence that babies so young show some social intelligence comes as no surprise to kiley hamlin .
she said one message for parents is that babies are able to figure out a lot on their own .
they are quite competent social creatures early on , she said .
they figure out the good guys to hang out with without much help .
professor oliver braddick of the university of oxford , uk , who was not part of the research study , agreed .
it shows how prepared babies are to learn the basics of social interaction at a very early age , he said .
but he said it is not yet clear whether the capacity described by the yale group relates to a real understanding of social life .
these babies are recognising interaction between other beings they are watching , he said .
these interactions we can imagine are a foundation for social understanding but i ' m not sure yet they truly reflect social understanding in the sense we would apply to an adult or older child .
previous research has shown that babies in the first six months of life show preferences for others based on the attractiveness of their face .
but it is not until the age of 18 months that toddlers are true social creatures , and will cooperate with others of their own accord .
